# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the famous MNIST dataset. The code, implemented in Google Colab, includes data preprocessing, model training using logistic regression, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix visualization.
